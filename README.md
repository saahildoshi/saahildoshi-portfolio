## 📁 Repository Overview

This project is built as a modular, component-driven portfolio using **Next.js 14 (App Router)**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, **shadcn/ui**, and **Framer Motion**.  
All major projects are dynamically rendered with responsive layouts, animated sections, and structured media galleries.

### **Main Directories**
/app → Route structure (projects, about, contact, etc.)
/components → Reusable UI + layout components
/public/images → All project images, figures, CAD renders, test graphs
/styles → Global and theme CSS
